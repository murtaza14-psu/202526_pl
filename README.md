# Football Match Outcome Prediction ⚽📊

This project uses **machine learning algorithms** to predict the **outcomes of individual football matches** based on historical match data.  
The model is trained on match statistics fetched from the **Football-Data.org API** and evaluates performance using standard classification metrics.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Fetches real match data using an external football API  
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering  
- Trains machine learning models for match outcome prediction  
- Evaluates model performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report  
- Secure API key handling using environment variables  

---

## 🧠 Machine Learning Models Used

- Random Forest Classifier 

## 📊 Target Variable

Match outcomes are classified as:
- **Home Win**
- **Draw**
- **Away Win**



## 🔑 API Setup

This project uses the **Football-Data.org API**.

## 🛠️ Installation

1. Clone the repository:
 
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/football-match-prediction.git

## 📈 Evaluation Metrics

* Accuracy Score
* Confusion Matrix
* Precision, Recall, and F1-Score

## 🔒 Security Notes

* API keys are stored in environment variables
* `.env` files are excluded from version control

## 🔮 Future Improvements
